      <p>Getting or a driver's license in Ontario may be considered a long process.
        However the government of Ontario has made the steps clear and provided a variety of resources to help throughout the process through refining the system.
        I hope this page will be a useful resource for you to learn the necessary information to gain your license.

      <h1 style="color: maroon; ">The three different licenses in Ontario</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>There are 3 exams in the Graduated Licensing program that you need to pass in order to get you an Ontario Driver's License.
        Each passed exam will lessen the restrictions on your ability to drive in the province.</p>

        <h2 class="borderexample"> <span style="color: red;">An advice:</span> Try completing a driving lessons program since it will help you to lower your insurance rates.
          It shows the insurance company that you have recieved a professional training which assures them that you are able to drive safe.</h2>
          <br><br>
          <h4 style="text-align: center;">This license must be on you at all times when driving. If you have a valid licence from your home country, you’ll probably be able to use this to drive in Canada for a short time after you arrive. Check with the government of your province or territory for details if you live outside Ontario. If you plan to use a foreign driver’s licence in Canada, you should get an International Driving Permit (IDP) in your home country. An IDP will give you a translation of your licence into French and English.</h4>
          <br><br>
          <h1 style="color: maroon;">Restrictions</h1>
          <br>
          <p>There are specific restrictions under Ontario Law that the drivers have to follow;
            these restrictions depend on your age and current level of the driver's license.
            The restrictions include information about the: legally permitted blood alcohol level, the orientation and seatbelt usage of passengers,
            eligible time of the day a person can drive, and what types of road a driver is allowed to drive on. </p>
