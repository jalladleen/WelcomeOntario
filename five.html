                <h2>My Experience <br><br><span>
                  Applying to universities was stressful especially for an immigrant like me who's the oldest
                  child in the family with no prior knowledge and guidance about the application process.
                  Being provided with the OUAC student's number and related needed information to start my applications was something new that I was never told about before. I was stressed and anxious, but with
                  doing my research about universities, applications, and different student experiences relieved the burden.
                  I have received my offers very late compared to my peers and I was so anxious; I would like to
                  comfort you if you are going through a similar experience, it's ok you will get your Offers
                  sooner or later! I am now studying Software Engineering at the University of Guelph :)
                  <br>Advice: if you are unsure about which program or university you would like to attend
                  then try to join tours to learn more about them!
