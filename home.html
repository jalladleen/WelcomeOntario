 		<h1>Canada's Latest Newcomer Essentials - February 1st 2021</h1>
 		<p style = "text-align: center;">Every first day of the month throughout year, there are endless categories that we have to be fully knowledgeable before stepping foot on Canada. However, there is too much information and over times can be quite overwhelming to balance every little thing that ranges from taxes, child benefit, housing plans, keeping an eye on the amount of limitations and so on. Therefore, we have compressed essential information into three categories that is updated frequently to ease that stressful process for newcomers, immigrants, and people that want to learn more about Canada.</p>
