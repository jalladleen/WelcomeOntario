        <br>
        <p>There are multiple housing options that are available with a wide range of budgets, health-related needs, and personal preferences. Although the options for housing are endless, moving in or obtaining a new home requires an informed decision as
            to whether you are purchasing or renting a property.

                    <p>Apartments within Mississauga Townhouse & detached homes offer more variety, family-friendly neighborhoods, and budget-friendly options that include three bedrooms, three bathrooms, wide open kitchen along with utilities and finished
                        basements.
                        <br><br>Owners are usually flexible with the tenants and are willing to compensate that will fit the tenant's needs.
                        <br><br>However, the houses are relatively aging from 5 to 30 years and would require a personal vehicle for travelling that includes grocery shopping, entertainment, and other purposes. Mississauga townhouse rent averages $1,750
                        a month for two bedroom or more apartments.</p>

                    <p>Condominiums within cities such as Toronto buildings include 2 Bedrooms, 1 Bathroom, kitchen which are fully furnished as well as utilities and cable and internet are included. Perks are that you are nearby multiple subways, landscaped
                        parks, cultural restaurants, and hundreds of shopping centers and groceries such as No Frills, Hasty Market, and Rabba Fine Foods.
                        <br><br>Usually, the owners rent those condominium buildings to potential tenants and the owners are contracted with a corporation that helps to take care of insurance, commission for maintenance.
                        <br><br>Due to the cost of living in major cities, the rent rates range expensively and are not budget-friendly. Toronto typically rent averages $1,753 a month for one bedroom condominiums.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A duplex housing has two living units attached to each other, which would include townhouses, condominiums, and apartments attached and above each other. Similarly, triplexes are contained in three living units and multiplexes are
                        more than three units.
                        <br><br>In Ontario, duplexes are typically purchased and are relevantly reasonably-priced if you are in the market for duplexes, most duplexes that range from 1100 to 2500 square feet located in Niagara Falls,
                        <br><br>Hamilton, and North Bay are usually priced under a million. However, triplexes and multiplexes are quite expensive due to the fact that Ontarians "house-hack" their multiplexes, the process of purchasing multiplexes and
                        renting out the units that would fully pay their mortgages.

                        <br><br>This route of housing is common among students and newly arrived immigrants who are looking for ways to save up and budget their finances.
                        <br><br>The room sharing rent rates averages $650 to $750 a month but that would also depend on the accommodation and location. More often than not, this experience left rents to open their eyes to newer possibilities, opportunities,
