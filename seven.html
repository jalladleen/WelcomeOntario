            <img src="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/ontario-elementary-school-rankings-2020.jpg" alt="elementary">
            <p>In Canada, students enter elementary school at the age of 4. This level of schooling starts at the kindergarten level (junior and senior year), and continues for 7 years till grade 5. Students are expected to be in school between an approximate time of 8:30am - 3:00pm. <br><br>Many elementary schools offer extra programs to help students early on in their education progress and development, to help them stay on top of their year, an often used program by international/immigrant families is ESL (English as a Second Language). Students within the ESL program are able to be provided extra attention and guidance within and outside the classroom to help them progress at the same rate as their peers. <br><br>Families with kids who attend elementary school also have the option for before, and after schools programs such as PLASP. The Before School Program operates from 7:30 a.m. and continues until school begins. Children participate in a variety of activities and enjoy a healthy breakfast, served daily. The After School Programs begin at school dismissal and continues until 6:00 p.m. Children are greeted by the same staff each day, which allows a sense of stability and familiarity to develop. <i>To learn more about PLASP visit: <a style="color: blue;"href="https://www.plasp.com/">https://www.plasp.com/</a></i></p>

            <img src="https://www.ontarioschools.org/GalleryImages/202132643156319_image.jpg" alt="middle school">
            <p>Middle school is the second and final grade school level for Canadian students (grades 6-8). Students tackle more complex learning skills in order to prepare them for the content and course loads that they will endure in highschool.
              <i>Kids usually attend middle schools in their teen years, around the age of 11.</i>
              <br><br>Middle school helps introduce concepts of different subjects taught through high rotary (a teacher per subject).
              The subject matter remains mostly the same as in elementary school, but now with considerably more detail and stricter standards of grading.
              The focus in middle school begins to shift away from creative, team projects, towards more individual, test-driven learning. </p>

            <p>The grades in a Canadian highschool are from grade 9-12.
              High school marks the most demanding phase of Canadian public education — both educationally and socially — and spans the late teenage years.
              <br><br>It concludes with a fancy graduation ceremony at the end of grade 12, when most students are 18 years old.
              Classes are now specified from the students preference, and electives are encouraged to be of interest to the student to further their hobbies or education.
              Students will also emabrake on the journey of standardized testing.
              <br><br>In order to successfully complete high school, and thus their entire grade school education, students must pass provincial exams in several subjects.
              These are written by the provincial government and intended to provide definitive assessment as to whether or not students have learned everything the government considers important.
              Students are treated with much more freedom and responsibilities, as adults.
              Besides, in order to graduate, students are expected to have earned 40 hours of volunteering and gained upto 30 credits.
              <br><br><i><b>Advice:</b> Many schools offer the Peer Tutor Program which allows you to volunteer tutoring other students who might need help in specific subjects. This will be helpful for other students and even for you as you gain
            more interpersonal skills, improve your and the tutee's academic level and introduce you to new people.</i>

                    <h2>My Experience <br><br><span>
                      I  moved to Canada from the UAE where I spent my Canadian curriculum education years there.
                      Due to my relocation to a new environment in grade 12 and my lack of knowledge about schools,
                      courses, grades, and system, my grades were drastically negatively affected by the beginning of the school's year
                      .There was a lack of proper guidance and advice given about the resources I can access to improve myself and learn about the
                      Canadian Schools. Initially, I was not enrolled in the ESL system which turned out to be beneficial for receiving support and having
                      an extra time when needed on tests, assignments, exams, and deadlines.
                      Once I got enrolled, my grades and my academic performance improved.
                      I have experienced unpleasant times with a discriminative biology teacher, and I was not able to drop out since he was the only available teacher in the school. However, staying in that course with that teacher negatively impacted my mental health. If you run into a similar situation,
                      I need you to know that there are online courses and night schools that you can enroll in.
                      When I knew about that, it was too late.
