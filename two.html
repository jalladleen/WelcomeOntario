    <br>
    <h2><i>Leen Al-Jallad</i></h2>
    <p>I am a permanent resident citizen, with a Middle Eastern background.
      I spent my childhood in Jordan, moved to the UAE and lived there for 10 years,
       moved to Canada last year as a senior student in high school.
       Today, I am studying Software Engineering at the University of Guelph.</p>
       <br><br>

       <p>My journey wasnâ€™t easy, since I relocated to Canada last year from the UAE,
         I faced challenges to adjust to the new curriculum and environment.
         The lack of knowledge about the system in Ontario, bad mental health, stress, anxiety, and fear were difficulties that I had to face.
          My experience motivated me to offer help, advice, and useful recommendations for anyone who has to go through a similar circumstances. </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Moving to a new country might be completely overwhelming, and I know it from a personal experience;
            I hope this website assets you to start a new chapter in your life.</p>
